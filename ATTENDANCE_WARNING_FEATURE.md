# Attendance Warning Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature helps users know if they have already uploaded attendance records for a particular sewa event, preventing confusion and duplicate submissions. The system checks by logged-in user, not by center, allowing multiple coordinators to work with the same center independently.

## Implementation Details

### 1. DataContext Enhancement
- Added `getExistingAttendanceForEventByUser(eventId: string, userId: string)` function
- This function searches through existing attendance records to find matches for the given event and logged-in user
- Returns the existing AttendanceRecord if found, or undefined if not found
- Kept original `getExistingAttendanceForEvent(eventId: string, centerId: string)` for backward compatibility

### 2. Attendance Page Enhancement
- Added state to track existing attendance: `existingAttendance`
- Added useEffect to check for existing attendance whenever the selected event changes (now user-based)
- Added visual warning message displayed below the event selection dropdown
- Updated logic to check by user ID instead of center ID for more accurate tracking

### 3. Warning Message Features
- Shows in red background to grab attention
- Displays the event details (place and department)
- Shows the date when attendance was previously submitted
- Shows the number of sewadars that were included in the previous submission
- Only appears when an existing attendance record is found

### 4. Visual Status Indicators (Refactored for DRY)
- **Green Checkmarks**: Added to SearchableEventSelect component, positioned BEFORE event names
- **Consistent Spacing**: Uses fixed-width container to ensure proper alignment
- **Dropdown Display**: Shows checkmark before each event that has existing attendance
- **Selected Event Display**: Shows checkmark before event name in the main button
- **Real-time Updates**: Indicators update automatically when center selection changes
- **DRY Implementation**: Single helper function for rendering events with checkmarks

## User Experience
When a user uses the attendance page:
1. **Visual Indicators**: Events with existing attendance (by the logged-in user) show a green checkmark (âœ“) in the dropdown list and selected event display
2. **Event Selection**: When selecting an event, the system automatically checks if the current user has already submitted attendance
3. **Warning Message**: If the user has already submitted attendance, a red warning message appears below the event dropdown with details
4. **Non-blocking**: Users can still proceed with the form if needed (for updates or corrections)
5. **User-Specific**: Each user sees only their own submission status, allowing multiple coordinators to work independently

### Visual Indicators
- **Green Checkmark**: Appears next to events that already have attendance submitted
- **Dropdown List**: Shows checkmarks for all events with existing attendance
- **Selected Event**: Shows checkmark in the main selection button when a completed event is selected

## Technical Benefits
- Prevents accidental duplicate submissions
- Provides immediate feedback without requiring additional API calls
- Uses existing data context for efficient checking
- Non-blocking - allows coordinators to proceed if they need to update attendance
- **DRY Principles**: Single functions for center ID retrieval and attendance checking
- **Maintainable Code**: Consistent rendering logic across all components
- **Clean Visual Design**: Proper spacing and alignment for all states

## Files Modified
- `contexts/DataContext.tsx` - Added utility function and interface updates
- `app/attendance/page.tsx` - Added warning display logic, state management, and attendance checking function
- `components/SearchableEventSelect.tsx` - Added green checkmark display for events with existing attendance
