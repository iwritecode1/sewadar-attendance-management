# Attendance Checkmarks Test

## Refactored Implementation

### DRY Principles Applied:
1. **getCurrentUserId()** - Single function to get current user ID, used by both useEffect and hasAttendanceForEvent
2. **getCurrentCenterId()** - Single function to get current center ID, used for sewadar fetching
3. **hasAttendanceForEvent()** - Single function to check attendance by user, used by both warning logic and checkmark display
4. **renderEventWithCheckmark()** - Single function to render events with consistent checkmark placement

### Visual Improvements:
1. **Checkmark Position**: Now appears BEFORE the sewa name (✓ BEAS - ENGINEERING)
2. **Consistent Spacing**: Uses fixed width container (w-6) to ensure proper alignment
3. **Clean Layout**: Both dropdown and selected state use the same rendering logic

### Code Quality:
- Eliminated duplicate logic for center ID retrieval
- Single source of truth for attendance checking
- Consistent visual rendering across all states
- Maintainable and extensible design

## Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Events with attendance (by current user) show green checkmark before name
- ✅ Events without attendance (by current user) show proper spacing alignment
- ✅ Selected event in trigger button shows checkmark if current user submitted attendance
- ✅ Dropdown items show checkmarks consistently based on user's submissions
- ✅ All components use the same user-based attendance checking logic
- ✅ Multiple users can work independently - each sees only their own submission status
